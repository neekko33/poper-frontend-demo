The experts say it is likely that the heatwave raised the temperature of the air through multiple factors.<br />\n<br />\nThey say clouds and fog usually form when the atmosphere is cooled by seawater. But they say the smaller temperature difference between the sea and air resulted in fewer clouds and less fog than usual.

Sendai City in northeastern Japan saw fog on only a single day last summer -- the lowest number since recordkeeping began in 1931.<br />\n<br />\nThe team also says evaporation of seawater led to a stronger greenhouse effect, trapping more heat in the atmosphere.

The area is known as one of the world's largest deposits of chrome, platinum, and other critical minerals.<br />\n<br />\nBy the end of June, the University of Tokyo team had drilled into a depth of 500 meters in the strata.<br />\n<br />\nSuzuki brought back to Japan some rock samples his team obtained so far.

But due to its dirty water, swimming there was banned a century ago. Now, the mayor has taken the plunge to show it's safe for the athletes.<br />\n<br />\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the river on Wednesday. She swam about 50 meters to showcase its improved water quality.<br />\n<br />\n\"The water is very pleasant. It doesn't have any taste of mud at all. It's quite clear even though we've had some bad weather. It's fresh, but not cold at all. It was so magnificent that I didn't want to get out,\" the mayor said.<br />\n<br />\nIn April, an international NGO that's been testing the water said high levels of e-coli bacteria would pose a risk to swimmers' health.<br />\n<br />\nSewage was to blame for the worsened water quality. Underneath the French capital lies a sewer system stretching over 2,500 kilometers.<br />\n<br />\nAs well as disposing of wastewater from households, it also carries rainwater. When the amount of water flowing into the system exceeds a certain level, it's drained into the Seine.<br />\n<br />\nTo clean up the river, this underground water storage facility was completed in May. It holds up to 50,000 cubic meters of water that will be pumped to a treatment plant and prevent sewage from getting into the Seine.<br />\n<br />\nThe measure saw e-coli bacteria levels drop last month to meet the domestic standard for bathing.<br />\n<br />\nLionel Cheylus of the Surfrider Foundation says: \"The water quality is improving day by day, and the Seine is gradually becoming swimmable. But rain may fall in the upper reaches, and the sun may weaken, so there are always risks of the water quality worsening.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Games' organizing committee says if bad weather reduces water quality, the triathlon swimming component may be canceled and the marathon swimming could be shifted to a different venue.","video_url":"https://vod-stream.nhk.jp/nhkworld/upld/medias/en/news/20240718_10_160481_HQ/index.m3u8","img_url":"https://www3.nhk.or.jp//nhkworld/upld/thumbnails/en/news/20240718_10_1418243_L.jpg","img_url_small":"https://www3.nhk.or.jp//nhkworld/upld/thumbnails/en/news/20240718_10_1418243_S.jpg","updated_at":"1721262840000"},{"id":"20240718_03","title":"Draft PALM summit communique stresses rules-based free, open maritime order","description":"Leaders from Japan and Pacific island nations are expected to issue a joint communique stressing their commitment to achieving a rules-based free and open maritime order, citing China's increased maritime activities and other global situations.","detail":"Leaders from Japan and Pacific island nations are expected to issue a joint communique stressing their commitment to achieving a rules-based free and open maritime order, citing China's increased maritime activities and other global situations.<br />\n<br />\nNHK obtained a draft of the document to be issued when the three-day Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting, attended by 18 countries and territories, wraps up in Tokyo on Thursday.<br />\n<br />\nThe draft says that with the international community facing diverse challenges, the bloc shares the stance of opposing any wars of aggression and unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or intimidation in any part of the world.<br />\n<br />\nAmid China's increasing maritime activities and North Korea's nuclear and missile development, it stresses the importance of upholding a free and open maritime order based on the rule of law.<br />\n<br />\nThe draft includes a mention of Japan's discharge of treated and diluted water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, for which the country has been seeking understanding.<br />\n<br />\nIt refers to the need to respond while heeding a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency that confirmed that the operation is consistent with international safety standards.<br />\n<br />\nBefore releasing the treated water into the ocean, the plant's operator dilutes it to reduce the tritium levels to about one-seventh of the World Health Organization's guidance level for drinking water.<br />\n<br />\nJapan's Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and other leaders will finalize the declaration at their summit talks to be held on Thursday.","img_url":"https://www3.nhk.or.jp//nhkworld/upld/thumbnails/en/news/20240718_03_1418240_L.jpg","img_url_small":"https://www3.nhk.or.jp//nhkworld/upld/thumbnails/en/news/20240718_03_1418240_S.jpg","updated_at":"1721259240000"},{"id":"20240718_07","title":"Biden tests positive for COVID-19","description":"The White House says US President Joe Biden tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday.
